This is a python program  which can be used to make a simple bridge MQTT to xPL.
so that something like Node Red can be used with an existing group of
legacy xPL nodes. All mapping of MQTT topics to xPL devices is handled in the configuration file.
The configuration file xplmqttbridge.conf must be present in the directory where the program is started, or in /etc/xplmqttbridge directory.
This program is written to run on python 2.7 on Linux boxes.
